- System info and process commands (`tasklist`, `systeminfo`)  
- Network utilities (`ipconfig`, `ping`, `netstat`)  
- Scripting fundamentals using `.bat` files  

## Key Skills Learnt 
- Strengthened my ability to navigate and troubleshoot Windows without a GUI.  
- Learned to extract system and network information quickly using only built-in tools.  
- Recognized the value of CMD proficiency in incident response and penetration testing contexts.
