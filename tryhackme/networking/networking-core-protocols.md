# Networking Core Protocols

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Networking Core Protocols](https://tryhackme.com/room/networkingcoreprotocols)

## Summary  
This room focused on critical network protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP, and ARP. I examined how they work under the hood and where attackers can exploit weaknesses. It helped bridge theoretical knowledge with practical packet behavior.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- TCP handshakes and port behavior  
- UDP communication flow  
- ICMP use in diagnostics (e.g., `ping`, `traceroute`)  
- ARP spoofing fundamentals  

## Key Skills Learnt
- Strengthened my ability to read and interpret packet behavior.  
- Learned how attackers manipulate lower-level protocols for reconnaissance or evasion.  
- Improved my detection skills by recognizing anomalous protocol usage.
