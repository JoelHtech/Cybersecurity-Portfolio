# Networking Concepts

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Networking Concepts](https://tryhackme.com/room/networkingconcepts)

## Summary  
This room introduced the core principles behind computer networking, including the OSI model and TCP/IP stack. It laid the groundwork for understanding how systems communicate and where vulnerabilities often exist. The layered approach to network design helped me map technical behaviors to real-world scenarios.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- OSI model (7 layers) vs. TCP/IP (4 layers)  
- Network addressing and segmentation  
- Protocol analysis (overview level)  
- Conceptual mapping of data flow from application to physical transmission  

## Key Skills Learnt 
- Developed a clear understanding of how data is structured and transmitted across networks.  
- Learned where common misconfigurations or weaknesses can appear at different layers.  
- Built a foundation to support deeper dives into protocol analysis, IDS/IPS systems, and firewalls.
