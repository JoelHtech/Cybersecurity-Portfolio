# Active Directory Basics

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Active Directory Basics](https://tryhackme.com/room/winadbasics)

## Summary  
This room introduced the foundational elements of Active Directory (AD) — a core part of enterprise Windows environments. I learned how domain controllers, users, groups, and permissions interact to form a structured and centralized identity management system. It gave me a clearer view of the attack surface that AD often presents.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- Domain hierarchy and architecture  
- Users, groups, and organizational units (OUs)  
- Authentication protocols (Kerberos, NTLM)  
- Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) interface  

## Key Skills Learnt
- Developed a solid understanding of how AD structures and controls access across networks.  
- Learned how attackers enumerate AD environments and identify privilege escalation paths.  
- Gained insight into why misconfigurations in AD can lead to widespread compromise — and how to prevent it.
