# Offensive Security Intro

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Offensive Security Intro](https://tryhackme.com/room/offensivesecurityinto)

## Summary
This room provided a strong introduction to offensive security practices and helped me understand the mindset behind ethical hacking. Working through simulated attack scenarios, I got hands-on experience with how adversaries might approach breaking into systems, from reconnaissance all the way through exploitation. It was a practical foundation for understanding the offensive side of cybersecurity.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- Reconnaissance and footprinting
- Basic exploitation flows
- Web application testing techniques
- Enumeration strategies

## Key Takeaways
- Learned how to approach systems from an attacker's perspective
- Gained a clearer understanding of how each stage of a penetration test builds on the previous
- Developed a security-first mindset that now informs how I look at systems - even from a defensive standpoint
