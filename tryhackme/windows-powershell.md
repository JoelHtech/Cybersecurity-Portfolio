**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Windows Powershell](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowspowershell)

## Summary  
This room introduced PowerShell as a more powerful and flexible alternative to the traditional Windows Command Line. I learned how to use cmdlets, work with objects, and perform complex tasks in fewer steps â€” an essential skill for both blue and red team roles.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- PowerShell cmdlets (`Get-Process`, `Get-Service`, `Get-Content`, etc.)  
- Pipelining and object handling  
- System administration tasks (users, files, services)  
- Script execution and automation basics  

## Key Skills Learnt
- Developed a strong foundation in PowerShell for both automation and live response.  
- Learned how attackers leverage PowerShell for stealthy operations, and how defenders can detect misuse.  
- Gained confidence using PowerShell for daily administration, auditing, and security tasks.
