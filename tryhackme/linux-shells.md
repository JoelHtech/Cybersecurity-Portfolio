# Linux Shells

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Linux Shells](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxshells)

## Summary  
This room covered the mechanics of interactive shells on Linux systems, particularly in the context of offensive security. I practiced working with reverse and bind shells, understood how different scripting languages can be used to generate shells, and explored how attackers establish persistence.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- Reverse and bind shell theory  
- Tools like `nc`, `bash`, and `python` for shell generation  
- Listener setup and connection debugging  
- Shell stabilization techniques (TTY upgrades, input handling)  

## Key Skills Learnt 
- Gained hands-on experience spawning, catching, and stabilizing Linux shells.  
- Improved understanding of post-exploitation workflows in a Linux environment.  
- Learned what to look for when detecting unauthorized remote access on Linux systems.
