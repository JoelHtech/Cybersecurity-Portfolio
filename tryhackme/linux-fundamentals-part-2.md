**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Linux Fundamentals Part 2](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart2)

## Summary
The second part of the Linux series focused on remote access, user management, and file permissions â€” all of which are essential for understanding how Linux systems control access. I also began chaining commands and redirecting output, which is a stepping stone toward automating tasks and writing scripts.

## Tools & Techniques Used
- Secure Shell (SSH) login
- File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- Command redirection (`>`, `>>`) and pipelines (`|`)
- User and group management basics

## Key Skills Learnt
- Learned how Linux handles access control, and why permission misconfigurations are often exploited.
- Became comfortable managing users and navigating permission structures.
- Started using more efficient terminal workflows that will be valuable in real assessments and automation.
