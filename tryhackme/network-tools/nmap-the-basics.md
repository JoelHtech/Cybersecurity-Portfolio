# Nmap: The Basics

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap)

## Summary  
This room introduced the foundational use of Nmap for network discovery, port scanning, and service enumeration. I practiced identifying open ports, service versions, and basic operating system fingerprints to understand a targetâ€™s exposure.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- Basic scans: `nmap -sS`, `nmap -sV`, `nmap -O`  
- Host discovery and ping sweeps  
- Service and version detection  
- Simple scripting with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

## Key Skills Learnt
- Learned how to conduct precise, efficient scans that minimize noise while gathering critical intel.  
- Recognized how port states and banners contribute to threat profiling.  
- Developed the habit of using scan results to guide the next steps in both offensive and defensive workflows.
