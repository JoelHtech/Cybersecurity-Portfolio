# Tcpdump: The Basics

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Tcpdump](https://tryhackme.com/room/tcpdump)

## Summary  
This room focused on command-line packet capture using `tcpdump`. Itâ€™s a lightweight but powerful alternative to GUI-based tools like Wireshark, ideal for live environments or remote incident response. I practiced filtering and saving traffic for analysis.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- `tcpdump` syntax and capture filters  
- Interface selection and live monitoring  
- Writing PCAPs for later analysis  
- Combining `tcpdump` with grep and scripts  

## Key Skills Learnt
- Became comfortable using `tcpdump` to monitor traffic in real-time.  
- Learned to narrow traffic based on protocol, port, or host.  
- Gained experience integrating `tcpdump` into broader forensic or pentest workflows.
