# Public Key Cryptography Basics

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Public Key Cryptography](https://tryhackme.com/room/publickeycrypto)

## Summary  
This room explained how asymmetric cryptography enables secure communication over insecure channels. I learned how public/private key pairs are used in digital signatures, SSL/TLS, and secure email systems.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- RSA key pair generation  
- Encryption/decryption using OpenSSL  
- Digital signature verification  
- Conceptual walkthrough of TLS handshakes

## Key Lessons Learnt
- Understood the mathematics and mechanics behind public key systems.  
- Learned how public keys can be shared openly without compromising security.  
- Gained insight into the security assumptions and risks in real-world cryptographic protocols.
