# Hashing Basics

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Hashing](https://tryhackme.com/room/hashingbasics)

## Summary  
This room focused on how hashing is used to verify integrity, store passwords securely, and detect tampering. I examined several hash functions and learned how even small changes in input drastically alter output.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- Common hash algorithms: MD5, SHA1, SHA256  
- Hash collision concepts  
- Password hashing vs. encryption  
- Hash cracking basics

## Key Takeaways  
- Learned the importance of using secure, collision-resistant hashing algorithms.  
- Understood how hashes protect integrity and where poor implementation causes failure.  
- Gained the ability to verify files, detect changes, and evaluate password storage practices.
