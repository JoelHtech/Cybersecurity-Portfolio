# Cryptography Basics

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Cryptography Basics](https://tryhackme.com/room/cryptographybasics)

## Summary  
This room explored the core principles of cryptography, including confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. It broke down symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption and demonstrated how modern cryptosystems are used to secure communications.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- Symmetric encryption (AES, DES)  
- Asymmetric encryption (RSA fundamentals)  
- Real-world examples: HTTPS, secure messaging  
- Concepts like key exchange, entropy, and brute-force resistance

## Key Skills Learnt 
- Developed a foundational understanding of how cryptography underpins secure systems.  
- Learned how different algorithms solve specific problems in confidentiality and authentication.  
- Gained the ability to assess weak encryption practices and understand common implementation flaws.
