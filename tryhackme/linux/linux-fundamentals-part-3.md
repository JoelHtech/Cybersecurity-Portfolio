**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Linux Fundamentals Part 3](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart3)

## Summary
In this final part of the Linux fundamentals series, I focused on process management, file manipulation, and system administration essentials. It gave me more confidence in interacting with live systems, especially when troubleshooting or exploring behavior during CTFs or assessments.

## Tools & Techniques Used
- Process management with `ps`, `top`, `kill`
- Archiving and compression (`tar`, `gzip`)
- File searching (`find`, `grep`)
- Service and system control basics

## Key Skills Learnt
- Developed a stronger ability to troubleshoot and monitor system processes.
- Learned how to search through file systems efficiently, which is especially useful in privilege escalation and forensic scenarios.
- Got comfortable performing small admin tasks â€” a crucial step toward working on real infrastructure.
