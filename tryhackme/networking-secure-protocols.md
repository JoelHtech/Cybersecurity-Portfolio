# Networking Secure Protocols

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Networking Secure Protocols](https://tryhackme.com/room/networkingsecureprotocols)

## Summary  
This room introduced secure versions of common protocols, including how encryption and tunneling can protect network traffic. I explored the use cases for TLS, SSH, and VPNs, and why weak configurations still pose a risk even when encryption is used.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- TLS/SSL handshake flow  
- SSH session security  
- VPN tunneling concepts (IPsec, OpenVPN)  
- Certificate-based authentication  

## Key Skills Learnt  
- Learned how secure protocols defend against eavesdropping and interception.  
- Identified real-world examples where misconfigured secure services were still vulnerable.  
- Built a stronger understanding of the trade-offs between usability, speed, and security.
