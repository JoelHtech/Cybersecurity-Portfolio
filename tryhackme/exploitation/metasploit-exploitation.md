**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Metasploit Exploitation](https://tryhackme.com/room/metasploitexploitation)

## Summary  
This room focused on using Metasploit to execute actual exploits and gain shells on vulnerable targets. I practiced launching attacks, managing Meterpreter sessions, and performing basic post-exploitation tasks.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- Exploit selection and configuration  
- Reverse shell payloads  
- Session interaction (Meterpreter basics)  
- System info gathering and file access

## Key Takeaways  
- Gained confidence executing exploits and handling live sessions.  
- Understood how misconfigurations, outdated software, and weak services lead to exploitation.  
- Learned the responsibilities around ethical use, cleanup, and documentation of successful tests.
