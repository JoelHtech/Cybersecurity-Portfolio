# Metasploit: Introduction

**Room URL**: [TryHackMe-Metasploit Introduction](https://tryhackme.com/room/metasploitintro)

## Summary  
This room introduced the Metasploit Framework and its modular structure for conducting penetration testing. I learned how to set up workspaces, search for exploits, and use auxiliary modules for scanning and enumeration.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- `msfconsole` basics  
- Module structure: exploit, payload, auxiliary, post  
- Environment setup with `set`, `use`, `run`  
- Integration with Nmap and database services

## Key Takeaways  
- Learned how to safely use Metasploit in a lab environment for controlled exploitation.  
- Developed familiarity with managing sessions, choosing payloads, and reading module documentation.  
- Built a foundation for more advanced exploitation and post-exploitation activities.
